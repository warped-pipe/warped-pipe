- 👀 I’m interested in space, satellites, radio, DIY, open source software, GNU/Linux, motorcycles, permaculture, aquaponics, and homesteading topics of many kinds! You may find me sifting through your local dumpster or e-waste store. Recently, I've been spending more time writing and making videos about DIY / electronics topics and how to utilize free, scavenged, and cheaply-purchased second hand items for parts to accomplish your electronics projects goals rather than purchasing ready-built modules can be more fun, save you some bucks and help the environment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Javascript. Also hardware hacking, + building automation systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on permaculture, aquaponics, and automated farming projects!
