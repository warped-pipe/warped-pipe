- 👀 I’m interested in space, satellites, radio, DIY, open source software, GNU/Linux, motorcycles, permaculture, aquaponics, and homesteading topics of many kinds! You may find me sifting through your local dumpster or e-waste store. Recently, I've been spending more time writing and making videos about DIY / electronics topics and how by utilizing free, scavenged, and cheaply-purchased second hand items -- you can achieve (and afford!) things you never thought you could have -- and live a better, more satisfied life in doing so. Ask me about green business entrepreneurship, or what ONE thing we could do to make an impact on our truly out of control consumerism-to-landfill pipeline problem.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Javascript. Also hardware hacking, + building automation systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on permaculture, aquaponics, and automated farming projects!
